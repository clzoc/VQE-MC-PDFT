  "title": "VQE-MC-PDFT: Code for Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory Calculations of Ground and Excited States of Complex Chemical Systems with Quantum Computers",
  "description": "Reproducible code repository accompanying the PNAS manuscript. Implements a hybrid quantum-classical framework combining the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory (MC-PDFT), featuring quantum circuit cutting for scalable active-space simulations and FEM-inspired readout error mitigation. Validated on C2, Cr2, and benzene using the Tencent Tianji-S2 superconducting quantum processor.",
